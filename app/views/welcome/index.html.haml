  TimeCert is a service for timestamping content. This provides evidence that something existed at a given time. TimeCert will give you the timestamp for when someone first referenced a given digest.
%p 
  A Digest is like a fingerprint for a chunk of data. Digests looks like this:
%p.digest
  a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3
%p 
  While this may not mean anything to you and me, an application can generate this digest very easily and compare it against other digests. Technically speaking it is a Hex encoded SHA1 digest.
%p
  To use this in your own application all you have to do is do a http get request at one of the following URLS, where you replace the digest with your own digest:

%h3 Embedded iframe
%p You can embed a digest within your own blog or web application. It will look like this:
%p
  %iframe{:src=>"/a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3.iframe",:width=>"450px",:height=>"30px"}

%p This can be done by pasting this code in to your html page and having your blog or application calculate the digest for it:

=source_code_select "<iframe src=\"http://timecert.org/a94a8fe5ccb19ba61c4c0873d391e987982fbbd3.iframe\" width=\"450px\" height=\"30px\"></frame>"
