h1. TimeCert

"TimeCert":http://timecert.org is a project to provide a trusted third-party timestamping service. It will essentially provide a timestamp for each SHA1 digest presented to it.

h3. Source Code Release

This is the second public release of TimeCert source code. We're releasing this mainly to encourage trust in our service. We also encourage others to run competing timestamping services. It is released under the "AGPL":http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html, which means that if you decide to run a competing service you will need to release your source changes as well. We recommend using GitHub's great forking feature for this.

h3. Getting started

"TimeCert":http://timecert.org currently uses Ruby on Rails and doesn't require any specific.
